# PAIR
This repository includes code demonstating Paired Autoencoders for Inference and Regularization (PAIR) on toy problems in inverse problems.
The linear PAIR example, with linear autoencoders and a linear map between latent spaces, shows how the method can recover anatomy (represented with randomized Shepp Logan Phantoms) from corresponding sinograms that result from computed tomography (CT) imaging.
The nonlinear PAIR example, with convolutional neural network autoencoders and a linear map between latent spaces, shows how the method can be used to deblur handwritten digits (MNIST).
