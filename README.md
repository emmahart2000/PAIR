# PAIR
This repository includes code demonstating Paired Autoencoders for Inference and Regularization (PAIR) on examples in inverse problems.


The SheppLogan linear PAIR example, with linear autoencoders and a linear map between latent spaces, shows how the method can recover anatomy (represented with randomized Shepp Logan Phantoms) from corresponding sinograms that result from computed tomography (CT) imaging.


The MNIST nonlinear PAIR example, with convolutional neural network autoencoders and a linear map between latent spaces, shows how the method can be used to deblur handwritten digits.
